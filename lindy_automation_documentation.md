## 🧠 Purpose
Automate responses to support-related emails, specifically **login issues**, using an AI agent and knowledge base, while allowing human review for complex cases.

---

## 🔁 Workflow Steps

### 🔹 Trigger
- **Event:** `EmailReceived`
- **Description:** Triggers whenever an email is received in your Gmail inbox.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Filter Incoming Emails
- **Condition:** Email subject or body contains keywords related to *login issues* (e.g., "can't login", "reset password", "login error").
- **Purpose:** Ensures the automation only responds to relevant login-related queries.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Search Knowledge Base
- **Action:** `Search Knowledge Base`
- **Query Input:** Extracted content from the user email.
- **Result:** Retrieves pre-written login troubleshooting steps or FAQ articles relevant to the issue.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: AI Agent Composes a Reply
- **Action:** `AI Agent`
- **Prompt to AI:**
  > “Based on this email: [user email content], and the retrieved knowledge base result: [knowledge base content], write a helpful and polite email with step-by-step login instructions. Keep the tone friendly and professional. If the issue is unclear, ask for more information.”

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Send Response
- **Action:** `Send Email`
- **To:** The email sender (automatically filled)
- **Subject:** Matches incoming subject with "RE:" prefix
- **Body:** Drafted by the AI agent based on the knowledge base
- **Additional Logic:** If the AI can't generate a confident response (e.g., missing info or complex case), flag the email for **manual review** instead of auto-sending.

## ⏱ Delay
> ⛔ *Note: A 3-minute delay was originally intended but is not included due to Lindy's current feature limitations.*

## 🤖 Automation Handling Summary

| Step | Action | Tool/Block Used |
|------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | Detect relevant email | `EmailReceived` trigger |
| 2 | Check if login-related | Condition logic |
| 3 | Search help docs | `Search Knowledge Base` |
| 4 | Draft smart response | `AI Agent` |
| 5 | Send auto-reply | `Send Email` (conditional) |
| 6 | (Optional) Manual review | If AI is unsure, notify human reviewer |

---

## 🧩 Future Improvements (Suggested)
- Add a delay before sending replies to make it feel more human (when Lindy supports it).
- Expand automation to include:
  - **Refund requests**
  - **Account updates**
- Implement tag-based or category-based workflows.
